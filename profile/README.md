## 🧠 Overview  

**Rain World** is a unique survival platformer that places players in a mysterious, decaying ecosystem where every creature has its own behavior and instincts. You play as a small, agile creature struggling to survive in a vast world filled with predators, shifting environments, and relentless weather.

Instead of traditional combat-focused gameplay, Rain World emphasizes movement, awareness, and adaptation. The environment itself is a constant threat, with heavy rains that periodically flood the world and force players to seek shelter and plan their routes carefully.

Designed with a minimalist narrative approach, the game encourages exploration and discovery, rewarding patience and observation rather than direct confrontation.
